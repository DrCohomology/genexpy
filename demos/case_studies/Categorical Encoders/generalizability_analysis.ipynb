    "# Generalizability analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizability is the property of an experimental study to yield similar results under different experimental conditions. \n",
    "If $\\mathbb P$ is the distribution of the results that the study can take, with support $\\mathcal X$, we define generalizability as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    Pr_{X, Y \\sim \\mathbb P^n} (\\text{MMD}(X, Y) < \\varepsilon), \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The probability that two samples of results of size $n$ are close w.r.t. a statistical distance (here, the MMD). \n",
    "Let, for semplicity, $\\text{MMD}_n := \\text{MMD}(X, Y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, one can relate the $\\alpha$-quantile of $\\text{MMD}_n$ ($q_n^\\alpha$) and $n$ with the following equation:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\log(n) \\approx -2 \\log(q_n^\\alpha) + \\beta, \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is a constant that depends on the kernel (for the MMD) and $\\mathbb P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the equation above and fixing $\\alpha^*$ and $\\varepsilon^*$, interpreted as a condition on how strict the generalizability requirements are, one easily gets an estimate for the number of experiments $n^*$ that guarantees generalizable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to do that in a few steps, as well as to reproduce the experimental results of the paper."

    "## The experimental results file\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental results should be stored in a pandas-readable parquet file. \n",
    "In particular, the schema of the results file has to contain \n",
    "1. The experimental factors (variables influencing the outcome of an experiment).\n",
    "2. A column for the alternatives (the benchmarked objects/methods).\n",
    "3. A column for the result of the evaluation of a single alternative under a single combination of factors (the target column).\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️\n",
    "If multiple scoring/metrics are used in the experiments, this should be included in an appropriate factor (called, for instance, `scoring`). \n",
    "Moreover, the metrics should either be all scores (such as ` sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score`) or all errors (such as ` sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`). \n",
    "At the moment, it is not possible to mix scores and errors due to the way rankings of the alternatives are constructed in `genexpy.utils.rankings.get_matrix_from_df`. \n",

    "## The configuration file\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is to fill in the configuration file, `config.yaml`. \n",

    "- The path to the file containing the experimental results, `data.dataset_path`\n",
    "- The description of the columns of the results file:\n",
    "    - Indicate the factors and their kind (held-constant, design, generalizability).   \n",
    "    - Indicate the name fo the column of alternatives, the target column, and whether the target is a score or an error.\n",
    "- The parameters for generalizability\n",
    "    - The kernels (for the MMD)   \n",
    "    - The thresholds $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification of experimental factors\n",
    "Held-constant factors are fixed to the indicated level. All other levels are ignored.\n",
    "Each combination of design factors (called a configuration) will have its own, independent, generalizability analysis. \n",
    "We want to get results that are generalizable w.r.t. the generalizability factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between $\\delta$ and $\\varepsilon$\n",
    "The code internally uses a parameter $\\varepsilon$ to determine when two experimental results are ``close'' together. \n",
    "As fixing this threshold is not trivial, we make it depend on another parameter, $\\delta$. \n",
    "The interpretation of $\\delta$ and the way it and $\\varepsilon$ relate is kernel-specific.\n",
    "More details are in Section 4.2 of the paper."
